# BundledMum Marketplace — Handoff

This handoff covers the BundledMum **MARKETPLACE** (now at
**bundledmum.com/marketplace**), the secondhand classifieds marketplace. It is a
**separate surface** from the main storefront (the rest of bundledmum.com), which
is documented in `handoff.md`. The two share one repo, one build, and — as of the
path move below — **one origin**, but they are different products with different
routes and **must not be conflated**.

> **Routing model changed (subdomain → path).** The marketplace was originally
> built to live on the subdomain `marketplace.bundledmum.com`, selected at
> runtime by a hostname check. That is blocked: **Lovable hosting allows only one
> primary custom domain and redirects all other connected domains to it**, so the
> subdomain cannot serve the app independently. The marketplace now lives on the
> **`/marketplace` path** of the main domain. Same project, repo, deploy, origin.
> This also removes the cross-origin auth problem entirely (see §5 auth note).

## 1. Goal
Stand up the runtime plumbing that lets one build serve two experiences from one
origin, split by URL path:
- `bundledmum.com/*` (everything except `/marketplace`) → existing storefront +
  admin (unchanged).
- `bundledmum.com/marketplace` → the new secondhand marketplace.

This pass is **plumbing only**: `/marketplace` renders a throwaway "Coming soon"
placeholder confirming the split works. No marketplace screens, listings, seller
dashboards, or checkout yet.

## 2. Current state (what's wired now)
- **Path split at the router root.** `src/App.tsx` is a thin shell that resolves
  `isMarketplace()` once and lazy-loads exactly one route tree.
  - `isMarketplace()` is `true` when `window.location.pathname` is `"/marketplace"`
    or starts with `"/marketplace/"`. Exact-or-prefix so sibling paths like
    `/marketplace-anything` are NOT captured. Single boolean, computed once at the
    top level.
  - Storefront/admin tree → `src/StorefrontApp.tsx` (the previous `App.tsx` body,
    moved **verbatim** — behaviour + appearance unchanged). Owns every path except
    `/marketplace`.
  - Marketplace tree → `src/marketplace/MarketplaceApp.tsx` (placeholder),
    mounted with `<BrowserRouter basename="/marketplace">` so its internal routes
    are relative to the base (placeholder `"/"` → `/marketplace`; a future
    `"/listings"` → `/marketplace/listings`) without hardcoding the prefix.
  - The two trees are **mutually exclusive** at the top level, so the storefront
    catch-all (`*`→NotFound) never sees `/marketplace`, and `/marketplace` never
    leaks into storefront routing. No storefront route begins with `/marketplace`
    (verified), so there is no collision.
- **Code splitting (unchanged).** Both trees are `React.lazy()` + `<Suspense>`
  (fallback = site-standard `BMLoadingAnimation`). Build output confirms the
  storefront stays its own ~5 MB chunk, loaded only when not on `/marketplace`.
- **Auth session storage: cookie storage RETAINED (not reverted).** See §5.
- **Verified in preview (localhost:8081):**
  - `/marketplace` → "BundledMum Marketplace / Coming soon" placeholder.
  - `/` → storefront homepage renders as before.
  - `/?view=marketplace` → now renders the **storefront** (the old query
    override was dropped — see §4).
  - Only console noise is Vite's HMR websocket warning (sandbox artifact, not
    app code). Production `npm run build` passes.

## 3. Active files
- `src/App.tsx` — thin top-level shell; picks the tree via `isMarketplace()`,
  lazy-loads it inside `<Suspense>`. (This pass: comments updated hostname→path;
  selection logic unchanged.)
- `src/lib/isMarketplace.ts` — the single path-based boolean. (This pass:
  switched from hostname+`?view` to `/marketplace` path.)
- `src/marketplace/MarketplaceApp.tsx` — minimal router + `/` placeholder. (This
  pass: added `basename="/marketplace"`.)
- `src/StorefrontApp.tsx` — the previous `App.tsx` body moved verbatim
  (storefront + admin + employee-portal). Untouched this pass.
- `src/integrations/supabase/authStorage.ts` — builds the Supabase client with
  cookie storage on bundledmum hosts, `localStorage` elsewhere. **Untouched this
  pass** (see §5). NOTE: its doc comments still say "cross-subdomain" /
  "marketplace.bundledmum.com"; those are now stale (single origin) but left
  as-is to avoid any risk to working auth — tidy in a later dedicated pass.
- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` — auto-generated; one-line delegation to
  `createBundledmumSupabaseClient(...)`. Untouched this pass.
- `package.json` / lockfile — `@supabase/ssr@^0.12.4` (added in the prior pass;
  still used by the retained cookie storage).

## 4. Failed attempts (with WHY)
- **True subdomain `marketplace.bundledmum.com` — BLOCKED by Lovable hosting.**
  The original design served the marketplace from its own subdomain, chosen by a
  `window.location.hostname` check. Lovable only allows one primary custom domain
  and 301-redirects every other connected domain to it, so the subdomain can
  never serve the app independently — it just bounces to the primary. Replaced
  with the `/marketplace` path on the main domain (this pass). The hostname check
  and its `?view=marketplace` dev override were removed with it.
- **`?view=marketplace` query override — dropped, not kept.** The prompt allowed
  keeping it "if cheap"; it is not. With the marketplace router now on
  `basename="/marketplace"`, triggering marketplace mode at a non-`/marketplace`
  URL would mount a basename router on a mismatched path → React Router renders
  blank. It is also now redundant: `/marketplace` resolves directly in dev,
  preview, and prod (all one origin), which was the only reason the override
  existed (the subdomain didn't resolve in dev).
- **Hand-rolled `document.cookie` storage adapter — rejected in the prior pass.**
  Supabase sessions routinely exceed the ~4KB per-cookie limit; a naive adapter
  would truncate and break login. Used `@supabase/ssr` (chunks correctly).
- No approaches were built and reverted during implementation.

## 5. Changes made (this pass)
- **Split signal switched from hostname to path** (`isMarketplace.ts`), marketplace
  router mounted under `basename="/marketplace"` (`MarketplaceApp.tsx`), App/comment
  updates. Lazy split and storefront/admin behaviour unchanged.

### Auth storage decision — cookie storage RETAINED (deliberately not reverted)
The prompt's preferred cleanup was to revert session storage to the plain
`localStorage` default now that everything is same-origin. **I did NOT revert**,
because reverting would log people out:
- **Existing live sessions are in cookies.** Since the cookie change shipped
  (merge `b92a181`), everyone who logged in on `bundledmum.com` has their session
  in `sb-*` cookies on `.bundledmum.com`, not in `localStorage`.
- **Reverting → forced logout wave.** A `localStorage`-backed client reads
  `localStorage`, finds nothing, and treats them as logged out — a one-time
  re-login for the whole active cohort. No data loss, but real disruption for
  zero functional gain.
- **Cookie storage is harmless same-origin.** A `.bundledmum.com` cookie is sent
  on `bundledmum.com/marketplace` (same origin); login works today (verified live
  after `b92a181`). Per the prompt: *"Auth working is more important than auth
  being tidy… leaving the working cookie storage in place is acceptable."*
- **Net:** `authStorage.ts` and `client.ts` are untouched this pass. Only their
  comments are now stale (they describe the old cross-subdomain rationale).

### Risk / open note on the auto-generated client (still stands)
`client.ts` is marked auto-generated. History: only 3 commits ever vs 8+ for its
schema-driven sibling `types.ts` — evidence it's regenerated rarely, not per
build/schema-change; exact Lovable trigger unconfirmed. **Risk:** a regeneration
would drop the one-line delegation and revert the client to plain `localStorage`
(cookie sessions become invisible → logout wave; nothing crashes). Mitigation:
all storage logic lives in `authStorage.ts`; recovery is re-adding one import +
call in `client.ts`.

## 6. Next steps
1. Build the real marketplace UI in `src/marketplace/` (replace the placeholder):
   landings, listing cards, listing detail, seller flows — per later prompts.
   Add routes as children under the `basename="/marketplace"` router.
2. Decide the marketplace's own provider needs (it currently shares nothing with
   the storefront). Add a QueryClient / cart / theme as those screens require.
3. Confirm on live that `bundledmum.com/marketplace` serves the placeholder and
   the storefront is unaffected, once this branch is merged + deployed.
4. **Auth tidy (optional, later):** if desired, revert to `localStorage` default
   in a dedicated pass — but expect a one-time logout of cookie-session users, so
   only do it deliberately (e.g. alongside comms), not as a drive-by cleanup.
   Also refresh the now-stale "cross-subdomain" comments in `authStorage.ts`.
5. Watch the `client.ts` regeneration risk above after any Lovable-side change.
